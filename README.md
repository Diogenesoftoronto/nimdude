# Nimdude

Nimdude is a personal site built with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and Go (for the backend). It's a site that uses [Prologue](https://planety.github.io/prologue/) to generate pages, routing and views. And it uses karax as a frontend ui library. It's a work in progress, but it's a good example of how to use Prologue and Karax together.

 The site showcases my skills as a software engineer specializing in Go backend development, as well as my interests in politics, philosophy, and VR.

## Movitivation

I built this site because I was having major issues working with the vugu library in the go world. Decided to try out Nim and Prologue since I was already using Go for the backend. It gives me a chance to see how well the two languages work together and how well I like using nim. I always wanted to try out nim, but I never had a good reason to use it. I'm hoping this will be a good reason.
