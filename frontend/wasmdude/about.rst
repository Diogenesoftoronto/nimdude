About Me
========

Poetic Introduction:
--------------------
    I am but a maker in a small Canadian town,
    Crafting software with rapid-fire, trying to hold it down.
    I am post-anarchist adjacent, or so they say,
    Though what that means, I cannot truly say.

    Each day I strive to learn, to keep my skills on the rise,
    Temporal, Go, and Unity, I never compromise.
    Yet humble must I be, for my journey's just begun,
    As the horizon of knowledge is wider than the sun.

    Feline friends I cherish, three in number are they,
    Ever by my side, as I toil and work and play.
    And when I need respite, from the toil and grind,
    I dive into a litRPGs, or Asimov, to ease my mind.

    Portfolios, blogs, and multiplayer games, I have many irons in the fire,
    And I'm making an app called Write and Tell, my greatest desire.
    But fame and fortune do not move me, nor drive me to excel,
    For true satisfaction comes from the difference we make, and the stories we tell.

    So raise a glass(of tea), to this humble(the humble never say they are) maker on thy journey to the stars,
    With a heart full of hope, and a mind full of scars.
    May I make a difference, and play my part aright,
    For in the end, it's not about me, it's about making things right.


Introduction
------------
Introductions are *hard*. Here is a short one:
    I am dio, a PoC software maker and enby (planning to write a whole thing about that soon that no one will read) based in a small Canadian town.
    I love all things tech, from contributing to FOSS projects to exploring the world of data science. 

    I also love posting about any philosophy papers. I am post-anarchist adjacent politically 🏴. If you know what that means (because I don't), that's awesome.

    When I'm not coding, you can usually find me lost in virtual reality, tinkering with Unity or experimenting with 3D printing. 
    I am sure you and the dozens of other similarly politically inclined would be happy for me to tag along in one of your reading groups.
    So if you're looking for someone to geek out with about tech or philosophy, feel free to reach out!
